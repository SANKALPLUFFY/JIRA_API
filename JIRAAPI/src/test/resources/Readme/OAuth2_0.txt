	   *  
	   *  1. Scope :-        Fields from resource servers ( Ex. Name, E mail, Phone No, etc) & for different resource type 
	   *                     there is separate end point i.e if client need Name & email, we will have to provide two different scope
	   *                     parameters in URL
	   *  2. Auth_URl:-      Which authorization server we are authorizing to provided by service provider , like Google
	   *  3. Client_ID:-     When client registers with service provider ( Google / Facebook / etc ) client ID & client secret ID
	   *   				     gets generated
	   *  4. Response_type:- What type of response to get from provider, in this case OPT / access code
	   *  5. Redirect_uri:-  After login & access token generation where provider shall redirect user to (to client page)
	   *
	   * If developer does not provide complete authorization code url then we can use above mentioned fields as query parameters(?)
	   * starting with Auth_url. 
	   * Then copy this entire URL and use it in browser which then will ask user to login with provider type from client and then
	   * it will redirect user to mentioned url which also contains the needed code
	   * After that we can use this generated authorization code to fetch access token.
